# Sample and Testing Machine Learning Android Code Scanner

This sample project demonstrates the new Google Code Scanner. It features a simple button to
initiate the scanner. For testing purposes, I generated a barcode containing a website link, which,
when scanned, opens the link in the browser. The project currently supports only opening website
links. It is implemented using Jetpack Compose. <br />
